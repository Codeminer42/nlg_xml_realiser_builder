# Simple NLG compatible XML Realiser Builder

This is still not a full featured builder for Simple NLG but the goal is to make it easier to compose the XML Realiser recordings.

There is an online service at https://nlg-service.herokuapp.com which embeds SimpleNLG in a web service.

Check out [nlg-service](https://github.com/Codeminer42/nlg_service) to see the Rails-API running under JRuby.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'nlg_xml_realiser_builder'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install nlg_xml_realiser_builder

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
